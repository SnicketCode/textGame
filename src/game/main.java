I then worked as an intern at both Telsa, and NASA.\" Suddenly the room burst into laughter and many of board instantly started scribbling down \"No\" near the application check marks. The Dean says \"Sorry but you are just not the type we are looking for.\" But then I said \"Excuse me but I wasn't finished... I watch Rick and Morty\" The Dean looked at me like an idiot and said \"So....?\" Then I replied with a smile \"And I understand all the references and subtle jokes\" An audible gasp let out by the board was so loud the secretary had to come in. You could hear a pin drop and then suddenly all at once the entire board clicked their pens on the \"Approved Box\" and I was instantly handed a diploma and now I'm teaching advanced physicals there. I guess you can say I'm pretty smart. :)");
